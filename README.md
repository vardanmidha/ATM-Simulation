# ATM-Simulation

It emulates the functionality of a real-world ATM, allowing users to perform common banking operations such as account creation, secure login, cash deposits, withdrawals, and checking account balances. The project uses a data structure called a doubly linked list to manage user accounts efficiently. Each node in the list represents a user account, storing details like card number, PIN, name, and cash balance.
